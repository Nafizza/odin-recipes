    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>A fish fry is a meal containing battered or breaded fried fish. It usually also includes french fries, coleslaw, macaroni salad, lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. Some Native American versions are cooked by coating fish with semolina and egg yolk.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fish</li>    
        <li>Ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>Green chilly</li>
        <li>Fish fry powder</li>
        <li>coriander</li>
        <li>chilly powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li>oil and ghee</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Fish: Clean the fish fillets and pat them dry. In a bowl, mix ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. Rub this mixture evenly onto the fish fillets. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>Coat the Fish: In a separate plate, mix rice flour and semolina (optional) to make a crispy coating. Gently coat the marinated fish in this mixture, ensuring an even layer on both sides.</li>
        <li>Fry the Fish: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the coated fish fillets for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Garnish with fresh coriander, and serve hot with lemon wedges and onion rings.</li>
    </ol>
