    <h2>Procedure</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Mutton: In a bowl, marinate mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes or overnight.</li>
        <li>Cook the Mutton: In a large pan, heat oil/ghee. Add whole spices (bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves), and fry until fragrant. Add sliced onions, cook until golden brown, then add tomatoes, green chilies, and marinated mutton. Cook until the mutton is tender, adding water if needed. Stir in garam masala and biryani masala.</li>
        <li>Cook the Rice: While the mutton is cooking, rinse and soak the basmati rice for 30 minutes. Boil the rice with whole spices (bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves) until it's 70% cooked. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        <li>Layer the Biryani: In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the cooked mutton at the bottom. Add half of the semi-cooked rice on top, followed by coriander, mint leaves, and a sprinkle of saffron milk (optional). Repeat with the remaining mutton and rice.</li>
        <li>Dum Cooking: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid (or seal with dough) to trap steam. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes ("dum" method) to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve: Fluff up the biryani gently, garnish with fried onions, and serve hot with raita or salad. Enjoy your mutton biryani!</l6>
